# Wifi-Sensing
my work include:
Integrating MQTT APP into Wifi_sensing app.
continusouly send messages to MQTT BOX about heartbeats, wifi and anchor data wrapped in JSON format.
adding a graph GUI that would draw time VS signal strength.
Adding a GUI to show the Wifi data of all networks.
automatically resolving existing anchors that are added by different phones.
only sending the wifi info if you are less than  1 meter away from the anchor.
